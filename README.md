# empty-mind

This is a rough attempt at a "mindful" list entry app.  

The goal is to be able to emit a stream of consciousness unburdened by overthinking or editing.

Once text is entered, it will fade away over time.  The button next to the text entry will copy all text ever entered into the clipboard for use elsewhere.

This is my first React App, so don't expect much.
